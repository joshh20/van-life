# Van Life - Portfolio Project

## Description

Van Life is a React application demo that I created with the help of a tutorial on [Scrimba's React Router Course](https://scrimba.com/learn/reactrouter6). With it, I learned how to use React Router to handle navigation within Single Page Applications (SPAs).
